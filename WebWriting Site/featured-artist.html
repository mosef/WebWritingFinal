							<h4>Building a bridge between Poetry and Design</h4>
						</a>
						<p>For years there’s been a slow resurgence in hand lettering from the design world. Hand lettering involves taking a completely different approach to the use of text in design, moving away from the skills used for traditional typography. Whilst typography concentrates on the art and technique of arranging type, generally using pre existing typefaces, hand-lettering is the art of drawing letters. To put it a little more simply, typography is graphic design, whereas lettering is illustration. It’s an old school style that’s made a comeback in the last two years. At the forefront of that retro art style is Adam Scott, local poet and visual artist from Covington.</p>
						<blockquote>
							<p class="quote">"There’s no two clients who are alike so why would I use the same tools?"</p>
							<footer>Adam Scott</footer>
						</blockquote>
						<p>Adam uses a variety of techniques in his style, all self taught, but finds that the technique alone isn’t enough to produce meaningful art. One night, after having racked his brain over a request from a client, he decided it was time for something different. Rather than just using the company name, Adam scoured his client’s site and gathered up each word he could find. After a few hours of sorting out the unnecessary and extracting the most beneficial information, Adam arranged the words into a poem. The poem was then used as the foundation, or the “meat” as he called it, for the new hand-illustrated logo. With a few calligraphy pens and some colored inks, Adam didn’t just illustrate a new logo, he started a brand.</p>

							<img class="artist-photo" src="images/logo-01.jpg" alt="" />
						</div>
						<p class="photo-subtext">The first of many logos Adam has made for local clientel.</p>
						<p>Every client on Adam’s growing list of commissions demanded that he repeat the process from his last client. The challenge, he said, was in “finding the right words. Most companies don’t have much to say about themselves and I don’t work for them. So if they can’t give me an idea of who and what they’re like then I guess they’re out of luck”.</p>
						<p>Adam’s unique style doesn’t just come from his ability to make company profiles lyrical. He’s also quite the craftsmen and has produces an incredibly intricate array of pens, inks, and brushes.</p>

						</div>
						<p class="photo-subtext">An assortment of hand made brush stems without the brass ink-nibs or bristles. As of taking this photo, Adam has made several new variations of these stems.</p>
						<p>Each one of his utensils was made on a lathe in a workshop a friend of his runs. Whenever he needs a tool for a new job there’s no using the ones he did on the previous one. Either the tool gets broken or gunked in ink, too far damaged to be re-used. Another factor is Adam’s need to keep things one-of-a-kind, “There’s no two clients who are alike so why would I use the same tools? Maybe there’s a brush that needs a steeper angle and fewer bristles to flare the L, or maybe their sign needs to be seen under a blacklight? There’s no way around it, each job has to have it’s own tools. It has to.”</p>
						<p>While most of the time Adam works on hand lettering, there’s still moments where he needs to make his designs digital. A few months ago a local whiskey maker contacted Adam to design a label for their newest batch. What made this batch special was it marked the first time where FatBoy, a whiskey company out of America, would be collaborating with a scotch distillery from Scotland. Adam took the challenge and felt quite honored saying “That job wasn’t just the result of my design popularity. It was the culmination of my skills and hard work over the years. I earned it and felt so grateful that they chose me for the job.” Most recently his work has been featured on TheDieLine, an online design award blog, and the results are proof that hand lettering has made it’s comeback.</p>
